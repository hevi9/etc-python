******************************************

Motivation: speedup start of programming by giving code skeleton for
specific tasks.

Functionalities:

  * F01 File and directory instantiation from templates
  * F02 Discover roots and template directories and files
  * F03 Property data creation, automatically or by user interaction
  * F04 Simple identifier property substitution
  * F05 Instantiation valid checks, no overwriting
  * F21 (later) Complex jinja2 property substitution
  * F22 (later) Simple identifier key discovery from template files.
