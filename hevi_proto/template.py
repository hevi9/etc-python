"""
Template based file creation system
===================================


Motivation: speedup start of programming by giving code skeleton for
specific tasks.

Functionalities:

  * File and directory instantiation from templates
  * Discover roots and template directories and files
  * Property data creation, automatically or by user interaction
  * Simple identifier property substitution
  * Instantiation valid checks, no overwriting
  * (later) Complex jinja2 property substitution
  * (later) Simple identifier key discovery from template files. 

Related works: alot, but not independent, build into some system.
